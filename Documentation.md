# The Software Development

### **1. Planning**

#### **What do you want to do?**
- **Goal**: Develop a Python program that takes a text file as input, performs a detailed analysis of the text, and outputs both statistical data and visualizations. The final output will be a downloadable PDF report summarizing the analysis and including the relevant visualizations.
  
#### **Requirements**:
  1. **Text File Input**: The program should accept a text file (e.g., `.txt`) and read its contents.
  2. **Text Analysis**: The program should count the number of:
     - Words
     - Sentences
     - Paragraphs
     - Characters (with and without spaces)
     - Calculate the average word length.
  3. **Visualizations**: Generate the following charts:
     - Bar chart for word, sentence, and paragraph counts.
     - Horizontal bar chart for character counts (with and without spaces).
     - Histogram for word length distribution.
  4. **PDF Report**: Create a downloadable PDF report that includes:
     - The text file input.
     - Summary of the analysis (statistics like word count, sentence count, etc.).
     - Generated visualizations as images.

#### **Constraints**:
- **File Format**: Only `.txt` files will be accepted for simplicity.
- **Libraries**: The project should use standard Python libraries and only lightweight external libraries (`nltk`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn` and `fpdf`).
- **Report Structure**: The PDF must be simple and clear, with limited customization options.

#### **Risks**:
- **Input File Size**: Large files may slow down analysis, especially during the tokenization of text.
  - **Mitigation**: Limit file size to a manageable number of characters or optimize processing techniques.
- **Tokenization Accuracy**: Incorrect splitting of sentences and words may occur in poorly formatted text files.
  - **Mitigation**: Use robust text processing libraries like `nltk` to handle various text cases (e.g., abbreviations, punctuation).
- **PDF Layout Complexity**: The process of embedding multiple visualizations into the PDF could be complex.
  - **Mitigation**: Keep the visual layout simple and standard, embedding images in a straightforward way.

### **2. Design**

#### **How will you do it?**

1. **Input Handling Component**:
   - **Objective**: Allow the user to upload a text file (`.txt`).
   - **Implementation**:
     - Use Python's `open()` function to read the file's contents.
     - Add error handling for cases where the file is missing, in the wrong format, or too large.

2. **Text Analysis Component**:
   - **Objective**: Analyze the text to count words, sentences, paragraphs, characters, and calculate average word length.
   - **Implementation**:
     - **Word Count**: Use `nltk.word_tokenize()`.
     - **Sentence Count**: Use `nltk.sent_tokenize()` or split based on common sentence terminators.
     - **Paragraph Count**: Split text based on double newline characters (`\n\n`).
     - **Character Count**: Use `len(text)` and `len(text.replace(" ", ""))` for with and without spaces.
     - **Average Word Length**: Compute using the total character count (without spaces) divided by the number of words.

3. **Visualization Component**:
   - **Objective**: Create and display the required charts.
   - **Implementation**:
     - Use `matplotlib` to generate:
       - A **bar chart** for word, sentence, and paragraph counts.
       - A **horizontal bar chart** for character counts.
       - A **histogram** for word length distribution.
     - Save the visualizations as `.png` images using `plt.savefig()`.

4. **PDF Generation Component**:
   - **Objective**: Generate a PDF report with the text file input, a summary of the analysis and including the charts.
   - **Implementation**:
     - Use `fpdf` to create the PDF.
     - Add text-based summaries (word counts, character counts, etc.).
     - Embed the saved chart images into the PDF using `fpdf.image()`.

#### **How do the components interact?**

1. **Input Handling**: 
   - The user uploads a `.txt` file.
   - The Input Handling component reads and stores the file's contents as a string.

2. **Text Analysis**:
   - The text string is passed to the Text Analysis component.
   - The analysis is performed, and word, sentence, paragraph, and character counts are returned as statistics.

3. **Visualization**:
   - The analysis results are passed to the Visualization component.
   - Charts are generated and saved as image files.

4. **PDF Generation**:
   - The analysis results and saved chart images are passed to the PDF Generation component.
   - A PDF report is created and saved to the user's system.

5. **User Interaction**:
   - The user uploads the file and downloads the PDF report after the analysis and visualizations are complete.

### **3. Implementation**

#### **Writing The Code**

Writing the code involves breaking down each component into well-defined functions. Each function should include docstrings that explain what the function does, the input it expects, and the output it returns. The main steps include:

Writing functions for reading the input file, performing text analysis, creating visualizations, and generating the PDF report.

Following good coding practices such as modularity, readability, and proper variable naming conventions.

Importantly, ensuring that all edge cases (e.g., empty files, incorrect formats) are handled gracefully.

### **4. Testing**

#### **Does the code do what it is supposed to do?**

Ensuring that the code functions as expected requires comprehensive testing:

Unit Testing: Each function should be tested individually using pytest. Key areas to test include:
Whether the file input is correctly processed.
Whether the text analysis functions return accurate results (e.g., correct word, sentence, and paragraph counts).
Whether the visualizations are generated without errors.
PDF generation should be tested to ensure that the final report includes both text and images as expected.
Error Handling: Tests should check that the program handles errors correctly, such as invalid file types or missing files.
Continuous Testing: Run pytest continuously during development to check if the code passes all test cases. Include screenshots of successful test runs in the documentation to demonstrate code reliability.

### **5. Documentation**

#### **How do you use the code? How does it work? How do you contribute to it?**

Documentation is essential for users and contributors to understand the code. Key components include:

User Guide: Explain how to install and run the software. Include details on how to upload a text file, what outputs to expect, and how to download the PDF report.
Developer Guide: For contributors, document the structure of the codebase and provide instructions on how to add new features, run tests, and submit contributions.
Docstrings: Ensure every function in the code is properly documented with docstrings explaining its purpose, parameters, and return values.
Screenshots: Include relevant screenshots showing examples of the input file, analysis results, visualizations, and the final PDF report.

### **6. Deployment**

#### **How do you share the code with others? How do you make it easy for others to use it?**

To share the project with others:

Packaging: Package the Python project for distribution, including all dependencies (like nltk, matplotlib, and fpdf) in a requirements.txt file.
Distribution: Consider uploading the package to PyPI (Python Package Index) to make it easily installable using pip. Provide installation instructions for users, such as:

`pip install thewordwizard`

Version Control: Use GitHub to host the codebase. Include a detailed README.md file that contains installation steps, usage examples, and contribution guidelines.
CI/CD Pipeline: Set up a Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline using tools like GitHub Actions to automate testing and deployment when changes are made.
